# üßµ Surface Defect Detection Demo ‚Äî Textile Production

This repository contains a **supervised deep-learning demo** for pixel-level defect segmentation in industrial textile images.  
A U-Net model, trained on manually labeled data, predicts surface anomalies. The demo includes a Flask web app where you can upload an image and instantly view the predicted defect mask side-by-side with the original.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash

#‚ÄÜ install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

#‚ÄÜ run the web demo
python3 src/demo/backend.py
````

Open **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)** and either upload your own 256 √ó 256 grayscale textile image **or pick one from the `Test/` folder**.

| Original               | Predicted Mask                     |

## üß† Model Training Summary

1. **Dataset**   DAGM 2007 (Class 1) resized to 256 √ó 256 grayscale
2. **Labels**    Binary defect masks (1 = defect, 0 = background)
3. **Training**  U-Net, 50 epochs, Adam (lr 1e-4), BCELoss
4. **Validation** 80 / 20 split; best weights saved as `unet_dagm_class1.pth`

> **Note:** This is supervised ML ‚Äî the network learns strictly from labeled examples.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Adapting to Your Production Line

* **Different materials?** Fine-tune with your own labeled dataset.
* **Other defect types?** Retrain with additional mask channels.
* **Edge deployment?** Containerized builds available for on-prem devices.
